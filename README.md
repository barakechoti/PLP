# 🎉 The Fun Calculator! 🎉

Welcome to my very first Python project—The Fun Calculator! I'm super excited to share this with you. This simple calculator lets you add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers, all from your terminal. 🚀

## Why I'm Excited
This is my first ever code, and I can't believe how much fun it is to see it work! I hope you enjoy using it as much as I enjoyed making it. 😊

## Features
- Addition ➕
- Subtraction ➖
- Multiplication ✖️
- Division ➗

## How to Use
1. **Clone this repository** to your computer.
2. **Open a terminal** and navigate to the project folder.
3. **Run the calculator** using Python:
   ```powershell
   python Calculator.py
   ```
4. **Follow the prompts** to enter two numbers.
5. **See the results** for sum, difference, product, and quotient!

## Example
```
Enter the first number: 5
Enter the second number: 2
Results of your two numbers:
Sum: 7.0
Difference: 3.0
Product: 10.0
Quotient: 2.5
```

## Note
- The calculator uses decimals, so you can enter numbers like `3.14` or `2.5`.
- Please don't try to divide by zero! 😅

Thank you for checking out my first code ever! If you have any feedback or just want to say hi, feel free to reach out. Happy calculating! 🥳


The Fun Calculator! 🧮
My First Working Code Submission 🎉
I'm incredibly excited to submit my very first working code project! This simple calculator is a huge milestone for me, and I can't wait to keep building and learning. This project demonstrates my understanding of basic Python programming concepts, including functions, loops, and conditional statements. I'm so proud of what I've accomplished!

About the Project 🧠
This is a fun and simple calculator program written in Python. It's designed to perform four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program is user-friendly and handles basic input validation to ensure that the user enters valid numbers and operations.

Key Features:
Simple and Intuitive: Easy for anyone to use.

Floating-Point Numbers: The calculator handles decimal numbers, allowing for more precise calculations.

Basic Input Validation: It prompts the user to re-enter a valid operation if an incorrect one is provided.

Error Handling: It includes a check to prevent division by zero, a common math disaster! 😅

How to Use 🚀
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/barakechoti/PLP.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd PLP

Run the script:

python Calculator.py

Follow the on-screen prompts to enter your numbers and choose an operation.

Code Breakdown 👨‍💻
The code is a single Python script (Calculator.py) that uses a while loop for user input to ensure that only valid numbers and operations are used. It then uses a series of if/elif statements to perform the correct calculation based on the user's choice.

Technologies Used
Python: The core language for the project.

Contribution
This is my first project, and I'm always open to feedback! If you have suggestions or would like to contribute, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
