# 🎉 The Fun Calculator! 🎉

Welcome to my very first Python project—The Fun Calculator! I'm super excited to share this with you. This simple calculator lets you add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers, all from your terminal. 🚀

## Why I'm Excited
This is my first ever code, and I can't believe how much fun it is to see it work! I hope you enjoy using it as much as I enjoyed making it. 😊

## Features
- Addition ➕
- Subtraction ➖
- Multiplication ✖️
- Division ➗

## How to Use
1. **Clone this repository** to your computer.
2. **Open a terminal** and navigate to the project folder.
3. **Run the calculator** using Python:
   ```powershell
   python Calculator.py
   ```
4. **Follow the prompts** to enter two numbers.
5. **See the results** for sum, difference, product, and quotient!

## Example
```
Enter the first number: 5
Enter the second number: 2
Results of your two numbers:
Sum: 7.0
Difference: 3.0
Product: 10.0
Quotient: 2.5
```

## Note
- The calculator uses decimals, so you can enter numbers like `3.14` or `2.5`.
- Please don't try to divide by zero! 😅
