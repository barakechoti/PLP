The Fun Calculator! 🧮
My First Working Code Submission 🎉
I'm incredibly excited to submit my very first working code project! This simple calculator is a huge milestone for me, and I can't wait to keep building and learning. This project demonstrates my understanding of basic Python programming concepts, including functions, loops, and conditional statements. I'm so proud of what I've accomplished!

About the Project 🧠
This is a fun and simple calculator program written in Python. It's designed to perform four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program is user-friendly and handles basic input validation to ensure that the user enters valid numbers and operations.

Key Features:
Simple and Intuitive: Easy for anyone to use.

Floating-Point Numbers: The calculator handles decimal numbers, allowing for more precise calculations.

Basic Input Validation: It prompts the user to re-enter a valid operation if an incorrect one is provided.

Error Handling: It includes a check to prevent division by zero, a common math disaster! 😅

How to Use 🚀
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/barakechoti/PLP.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd PLP

Run the script:

python Calculator.py

Follow the on-screen prompts to enter your numbers and choose an operation.

Code Breakdown 👨‍💻
The code is a single Python script (Calculator.py) that uses a while loop for user input to ensure that only valid numbers and operations are used. It then uses a series of if/elif statements to perform the correct calculation based on the user's choice.

Technologies Used
Python: The core language for the project.

Contribution
This is my first project, and I'm always open to feedback! If you have suggestions or would like to contribute, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
